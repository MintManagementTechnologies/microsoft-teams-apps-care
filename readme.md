# IT Care / Customer Care Application Template
| [Deployment guide](/Guides/DeploymentGuide) | [Architecture](/Guides/ArchitectureGuide) |
| ---- | ---- | 

The Customer Care / IT Care template assists with 
an implementation of an end-to-end customer engagement/interaction solution and an 
end-to-end IT Service system, to increase customer engagement and advance the time consumed against 
people and operational processes within the organisation and within customer engagement.

The solutions will allow for more efficient raising of requests and cases, more efficient collaboration
between Teams assigned to resolve requests and cases, and better reporting to maximum efficiencies of the 
business processes and goals.
